In this chapter we're going to open a new repository on GitHub and commit everything to it. We will learn about issues, pull requests (PR), branches, etc. And talk about the way we're going to work with GitHub for the rest of the series. We'll also start a new [Angular](https://angular.io/) application with [Angular CLI](https://cli.angular.io/), create the backend project with [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) and the [express](https://expressjs.com/) framework, and install all the packages we'll need for the client and backend.

&nbsp;

## 1. GitHub Workflow

There are a lot of workflows out there for software development, but 2 of them are the most popular in the git world. The first is [git-flow](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model) written by Vincent Driessen back in 2010. The second one, and the one we'll be using is [GitHub flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow).

The reason we choose Github flow instead of git-flow lies in what we build, a web app. We'll not have "releases", not roll back changes, and not support multiple versions of our software. This is because we'll have a [CI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration)/[CD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_delivery) that will automatically run tests and deploy our changes to production.

It'll probably be a bit wired to work by GitHub flow when we're working alone on the project. But it will keep our `master` branch clean, and it's important for you to know this workflow and get used to it, because this is how you'll work in a team and in an open source project.

So, every project have a `master` branch. This is the main branch, the production branch. It's a regular branch, nothing fancy about it, it's just called `master` (we actually can call it however we want, but this is the naming convention). And when we have a feature, idea, bug, etc we open an issue for it. In the issue we describe the problem, what we're going to do, maybe write some ToDos, upload a picture, discuss about it with other team members, and when we're ready to start working on it we create a branch.

Like we already said, a branch can be called anything, but it's got to be unique in the repo (you cannot have 2 active (not deleted) branches with the same name), and naming things is one of the hardest problems in computer science, so I love to just called it be number, the number of the GitHub issue, because it's also unique in the repo (an increasing number).

When we create a branch in your project, we're creating an environment that don't affect the `master` branch, so we're free to experiment and commit changes, safe in the knowledge that our branch won't be merged until it's ready.

{{< admonition type=info title="Pro Tip" open=true >}}
Branching is a core concept in Git, and the entire GitHub flow is based upon it. There's only one rule: anything in the `master` branch is always deployable. Because of this, it's extremely important that our new branch is created off of master when working on a feature or a fix.
{{< /admonition >}}

Once our branch has been created, it's time to start making changes. Whenever we add, edit, or delete a file, we'll make a commit, and adding the changes to our branch. This process of adding commits keeps track of our progress as we work on a feature branch.

{{< admonition type=info title="Pro Tip" open=true >}}
Commits also create a transparent history of out work that others can follow to understand what we've done and why. Each commit has an associated commit message, which is a description explaining why a particular change was made. Furthermore, each commit is considered a separate unit of change. This lets you roll back changes if a bug is found, or if we decide to head in a different direction.
{{< /admonition >}}

Pull Requests initiate discussion about our commits. We can open a Pull Request at any point during the development process: when we have little or no code but want to share some screenshots or general ideas, when we're stuck and need help or advice, or when we're ready for someone to review our work.

In our case, we're going to open a new Pull Request (PR) right after the first new commit in our new branch (all we need to open a PR is just one change, so right after the first commit we have a change and we can open it). This is a good practice, it let others see the direction and progress we are making.

In a real world environment we'll probably have a CI/CD that will deploy our branch to a test environment so we can test our changes before merge them to `master`, in our case we'll settle just for passing the tests. Every commit we'll push on our branch will trigger a GitHub action _workflow_ that will build our project, run tests and check the coverage of our tests. This is another good reason to push commits as early and as often as possible.

When we'll finish the feature, bug, etc another team member will probably review our code (assuming our tests pass and everything is green). In our case we'll do it to ourselves. Once we're sure everything is good we'll _squash and merge_ our branch to `master` branch, this will close our PR and our issue (that's good because we no longer have a need for them).

And then in our local machine we'll `checkout` to `master` branch, and `pull` the changes we just merge to the remote (GitHub) `master` (usually called `origin`), and the cycle will start all over again with a new issue (feature, bug, etc).

{{< admonition type=info title="Pro Tip" open=true >}}
Once merged, Pull Requests preserve a record of the historical changes to your code. Because they're searchable, they let anyone go back in time to understand why and how a decision was made.
{{< /admonition >}}

Once our web apps are use in production we'll sometimes need to do a quick bug fix, assuming it's an emergency (all hell break loss in our production site) we'll not want to go over the whole process, we'll just want to add one commit to the `master` branch, and that's it, a really quick fix to fix some production issue.

This will not happen often (assuming we're working correctly, writing test, doing peer code review, etc) but sometimes it will, in those cases we'll just push a commit or two to `master` and then will have to `merge` `master` branch to our PR branch so that they will by in sync and to resolve code conflicts that emerge during the quick fix.

This is how the whole process will look like on our `git log`:

{{< mermaid >}}
gitGraph:
options
{ "nodeSpacing": 150, "nodeRadius": 10 }
end
commit
branch feature
checkout feature
commit
commit
checkout master
commit
merge feature
{{< /mermaid >}}

&nbsp;

## 2. Scaffolding Basic Client

Now that we know how to work with git and GitHub are going to open our client repository and scaffold our frontend project. The first commit will be on `master` (without an issue and a pull request), because when we are open a PR it need a _base_ branch to merge it to, and when we first open a repository we don't have and branch.

### 2.1. Create A Repository

So let's start by open a new repository on GitHub, we can do it by pressing on the `+` sign in next to our profile picture, and then choose _New repository_

![Open a New Repository](/posts/2020/chapter-3-simple-twitter/new-repository.webp "Open a New Repository")

After that we'll be redirect to a new page when we need to fill some basic information about our repo. The name I choose for the repo is `simple-twitter-client` and it'll be a `public` repo, other then those you can leave everything as is and press on the big green button that says _Create Repository_.

### 2.2. Scaffold an Angular Project

In _Simple Twitter - Chapter 1: Setup_ we installed the [Angular CLI](https://cli.angular.io), now we're going to use it. Let's open our terminal on our local machine, I'm using [Hyper](https://hyper.is/) but you can use which ever terminal you used to, and navigate to the directory we want our project to be in (in my case it'll be a `web` directory in home).

```shell
$ cd ~/web
```

Once we're in the desirable directory we will create a new Angular project, using the [Angular CLI](https://cli.angular.io). To do that we use the `new` command and after it give the name of the project (will be the name of the repo we created). After the Angular CLI start to work it'll ask us a bunch of questions, and we'll answer `y` to the routing one (yes we want the cli to add a routing file for us) and we'll choose [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/) for the stylesheet (don't worry if you don't know `scss`, it's just like `css` but with superpowers. We'll go over them once we start coding).

```shell
$ ng new simple-twitter-client
```

![Create a new project](/posts/2020/chapter-3-simple-twitter/ng-create-a-new-project.webp "Create a new project")

Once the cli stop working we can see (with the `ls` command) that he created a new directory for us (with the name we gave it earlier). Let's navigate inside it (with the `cd` command), and, again, list the files inside the directory we're in (with `ls` command, but now let's use the `-a` flag to also see all of the hidden files - files and directories that start with `.` and by that not listed = hidden, in our file explorer).

![List all the files and directories](/posts/2020/chapter-3-simple-twitter/list-files-ng-directory.webp "List all the files and directories")

We can see there is a git directory called `.git`. This directory hold all of the git stuff for our project, it's like a mini database with a log of all the commits and changes we do. Angular CLI created it for us, but it doesn't know our GitHub repository, we need to manually let our git know about it. So let's head back to the GitHub repo, and there we can see couple of instructions, we'll use the _…or push an existing repository from the command line_ one.

![Our Newly Created Repo](/posts/2020/chapter-3-simple-twitter/empty-repo.webp "Our Newly Created Repo")

{{< admonition type=warning title="Pro Tip" open=true >}}
If you haven't setup your SSH key on GitHub yet, [generating a new SSH key](https://help.github.com/en/enterprise/2.17/user/github/authenticating-to-github/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent#generating-a-new-ssh-key) and then [add it to your GitHub account](https://help.github.com/en/enterprise/2.15/user/articles/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account). Now you can clone and push to repos with ssh (you can also do it with `https` but you'll need to enter your password every time).
{{< /admonition >}}

So as we can read in the instructions we need to `add` a `remote` and we call it `origin`, this will point to our repo. So every time we'll push a new thing (branch, commit, etc) to `origin` it'll push it to our remote GitHub repo. Let's do it!

```shell
$ git remote add origin git@github.com:nirgn975/simple-twitter-client.git
$ git push -u origin master
```

If you didn't get any git errors, you can see on your terminal it `push` your local `master` branch to the `origin` (remote, GitHub one) `master` branch. Now when we go to our repo GitHub page and refresh the page we'll see all of our directories and files.

![Our repo after push to master](/posts/2020/chapter-3-simple-twitter/first-commit.webp "Our repo after push to master")

### 2.3. Install additional modules

Now that we have a `master` branch with basic Angular project in it, let's create our first issue. I'll give it the title _Configuration_, and will add some TODOs to it so we don't need to remember our tasks.

```markdown
- [ ] Install and configure the [ngrx](https://ngrx.io) package.
- [ ] Install and configure the [material](https://material.angular.io) package.
- [ ] Create a `core` module with basic configuration.
- [ ] Add basic SCSS style.
```

Plus I'll assign this issue to myself (not that it's matter, because we're working alone), add an `enhancement` label, and add it to `Chapter 3` milestone (the last one is just to keep track of things for myself while I'm build it, and to keep things organized in the repo for future readers).

![Our first issue](/posts/2020/chapter-3-simple-twitter/configuration-issue.webp "Our first issue")

When we created the issue, GitHub give it a unique number, in this case, because it's our first issue / pull request, it the number `#1`. So, like we mention in the GitHub workflow, we'll create a new branch with the name `1` (with the `branch` command) and then move from `master` branch to our new branch (with the `checkout` command).

```shell
$ git branch 1
$ git checkout 1
```

Now, if you'll type in the terminal `git status`, it'll tell us we're `On branch 1`.

The first task is to install the [ngrx](https://ngrx.io) packages. ngrx as a whole is a state management for Angular applications, and the first package we need to install is the [store](https://ngrx.io/guide/store), which is the state itself. Because we're on angular version higher then 6 we can use the `add` command to install and configure the package.

After we did that we need to add couple of more packages. The first is the [store-devtools](https://ngrx.io/guide/store-devtools) so we can see a visual representation of our store and debug it if we need to. The second is the [effects](https://ngrx.io/guide/effects) which is a way to interact with Angular services and isolate them from the components.

In short, it's the reactive way to handle external interactions (such as fetching data (network requests, web socket messages), long-running tasks that produce multiple events, etc). In the effects you should write most/all of you application "business logic".

```bash
$ ng add @ngrx/store
$ ng add @ngrx/store-devtools
$ ng add @ngrx/effects
```

After we did all of that, we can `commit` the changes and not that we have our first commit in the new branch we can push the branch to the GitHub (`origin`) repo and create a PR (Pull Request).

```bash
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "Install ngrx packages"
$ git push origin 1
```

Now if we go to the `Pull requests` tab on GitHub, we can create a new pull request for that branch (if you push the branch for the first time, GitHub will even suggest to create a PR).

![GitHub Suggest Pull Request](/posts/2020/chapter-3-simple-twitter/github-suggest-pull-request.webp "GitHub Suggest Pull Request")

When we click on it, we redirect to a new page to edit the details of the new PR. For convenient we'll use couple of self conventions, we'll give the PR the title we used in the issue, we'll assign the PR to ourselves (because the issue is also assigned to us), and we'll write in the description that this PR is _"Closes #1"_. This description is linking our PR with the issue, so if we hover on the `#1` part we can see the issue details (if we click on it we're redirect to the issue page), and when we'll close this PR the issue will automatically will also close itself.

The last thing to check before we actually open the Pull Request is that the `base` branch is `master` and `compare` is `1`. Because we want to open a PR for the branch named `1` and to merge it to the branch named `master` (which is our main branch in the project).

![First Pull Request Opened](/posts/2020/chapter-3-simple-twitter/first-pull-request-opened.webp "First Pull Request Opened")

Now we can head over to the issue page and mark the first task as done. hooray! :tada:

The next package we need is the [Angular Material](https://material.angular.io). To install and configure it we'll also use the angular-cli `add` command, and we'll pick the "Indigo/Pink" theme for now, we'll choose `Y` to _"Set up global Angular Material typography styles"_ and `Y` to _"Set up browser animations for Angular Material"_.

```bash
$ ng add @angular/material
```

Last time (when we install `ngrx`) we were done by now, but with the material package we need to do some stuff, to get ourselves ready for the future. We'll use the material components pretty much all over our app, this means in the main module and also in the different modules we'll create, import, or navigate to. And the one thing we're not want to do is to import them in couple of places, this will not be fun and / or efficient (if we already `import` the component we want to use the same one and not to import another instance of the same thing - duplication).

To achieve that we'll crate a [shard module](https://angular.io/guide/sharing-ngmodules) to import all of the material components, and we'll import just that module to all of our other modules that need to use material components.

Shard module is just a regular module, we'll create a new directory inside of `app` called `modules` where we'll put all of our modules in. Next, we'll create our new module using the angular-cli. We'll call that module `material` and the ng cli will create a new directory for it, and a module file with the same name.

```bash
$ cd src/app
$ mkdir -p modules
$ ng g module modules/material
```

Now we have a new module, but it's not a _"shard"_ one yet, we need to add an `exports` array to the `NgModule` object, so every module we add to the `imports` array should also be added to the `exports` array.

```typescript
import { NgModule } from "@angular/core";
import { CommonModule } from "@angular/common";

@NgModule({
  declarations: [],
  imports: [CommonModule],
  exports: [],
})
export class MaterialModule {}
```

After we created our new shard module we need to import it in the main module, e.g. `AppModule`. So we'll add the line `import { MaterialModule } from './modules/material/material.module';` with the other imports in the `app.module.ts` file, and add `MaterialModule` to the `imports` array. Your `app.module.ts` file should look like this:

```typescript
import { BrowserModule } from "@angular/platform-browser";
import { NgModule } from "@angular/core";

import { environment } from "../environments/environment";

import { StoreModule } from "@ngrx/store";
import { StoreDevtoolsModule } from "@ngrx/store-devtools";
import { EffectsModule } from "@ngrx/effects";

import { BrowserAnimationsModule } from "@angular/platform-browser/animations";
import { MaterialModule } from "./modules/material/material.module";

import { AppRoutingModule } from "./app-routing.module";
import { AppComponent } from "./app.component";

@NgModule({
  declarations: [AppComponent],
  imports: [
    BrowserModule,
    AppRoutingModule,
    StoreModule.forRoot({}, {}),
    StoreDevtoolsModule.instrument({ maxAge: 25, logOnly: environment.production }),
    EffectsModule.forRoot([]),
    BrowserAnimationsModule,
    MaterialModule,
  ],
  providers: [],
  bootstrap: [AppComponent],
})
export class AppModule {}
```

To check if material is working we can `import` some angular material component (for example the button component) and add it to the `app.component.html`, then when we start our app we'll see the button rendered in the browser.

We'll add the below line to the `material.module.ts` file and add `MatButtonModule` to the `imports` array and the `exports` array.

```typescript
import { MatButtonModule } from "@angular/material/button";
```

Next, we'll delete all of the content in the `app.component.html` file add add the below line instead.

```html
<button mat-raised-button color="primary">Primary</button>
```

Then, when we `npm start` the angular app (run this command at the terminal when in the root directory of the project), and navigate to it in the browser at [localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200) we can see the button on the screen.

![Localhost Material Button](/posts/2020/chapter-3-simple-twitter/localhost-material-button.webp "Localhost Material Button")

Now we should `commit` our changes, push it to GitHub, and we can mark another task in the [Configuration #1 Issue](https://github.com/nirgn975/simple-twitter-client/issues/1) as done.

### 2.4. Some basic stuff

The next 2 tasks in our issue is to create a `core` module and add some `scss` basic styling. The `core` module should be a shard module, like the `material` one, and it should contain all of the stuff we'll `import` in the different modules (like `HttpClientModule`, `RouterModule`, `FormsModule`, etc). It also will contain some shard code, like `guards`, `models`, `services`, and `components` (but it's not relevant now, we'll talk about it when we need to).

For now, let's create it and `import` and `export` some basic modules (that we know we're going to use). We'll create the module with ng cli

```bash
$ ng g module modules/core
```

And then `imports` and `exports` some basic stuff in it. Let's import the `HttpClientModule`, `FormsModule` and `ReactiveFormsModule`. The `core.module.ts` file should look like

```typescript
import { NgModule } from "@angular/core";
import { CommonModule } from "@angular/common";

import { HttpClientModule } from "@angular/common/http";
import { FormsModule, ReactiveFormsModule } from "@angular/forms";

@NgModule({
  declarations: [],
  imports: [CommonModule, HttpClientModule, FormsModule, ReactiveFormsModule],
  exports: [HttpClientModule, FormsModule, ReactiveFormsModule],
})
export class CoreModule {}
```

Then, all that left to do is to import the `CoreModule` in the `AppModule`, like we did with the `MaterialModule`, and `commit` and `push` the new changes.

The last item on our issue's to-do list is the basic `scss` styling. This is just some css rules that we need to write in the `style.scss` located in the `src` directory.

```scss
html,
body {
  height: 100%;
  padding: 0;
  margin: 0;
}

body {
  margin: 0;
  font-family: Roboto, "Helvetica Neue", sans-serif;
}

a {
  text-decoration: none;
}
```

And now we can `commit` and `push`, again, and check all of the tasks in the issue. Before we'll `merge` the Pull Request (`1`) to the base branch (`master`) we'll go over the [_"Files changed tab"_](https://github.com/nirgn975/simple-twitter-client/pull/3/files) and check all of our changes that our PR is going to make to the `master` branch, just to check everything together for the last time, and when we're sure that everything is looking good, we'll head back to the _" Conversation"_ tab and scroll down to _"Squash and merge"_ the pull request.

![Squash And Merge](/posts/2020/chapter-3-simple-twitter/squash-and-merge.webp "Squash And Merge")

### 2.5. Tests

The next issue we'll open will be to add GitHub action workflow, for CI (Continuous Integration), the title we'll give it is `Add GitHub action for tests`, we'll assign it to ourselves, add a `CI/CD` label, and a description with a to-do list of all of the tasks we're going to do in this pull request.

```markdown
- [ ] Create a GitHub action workflow to run lint and tests.
- [ ] Add [codecov](https://codecov.io) to the GitHub action.
- [ ] Add badges to `README.md` file.
```

![Second GitHub Issue](/posts/2020/chapter-3-simple-twitter/second-github-issue.webp "Second GitHub Issue")

In the terminal we're still on `1` branch, we need to go back to `master` branch, delete the `1` branch (because we no longer need it), pull the changes that we made in GitHub (`origin`) to our local machine, and then create a new branch named `4` (because that's the number of our new issue).

```bash
$ git checkout master
$ git branch -D 1
$ git pull origin master
$ git checkout -b 4
```

To run the linter and the tests we can check the `scripts` object in the `package.json` file, and we can see there is a `test` script, so let's run it

```bash
$ npm test
```

Now, some test are obviously will break, because we made some changes to the default project that the ng cli created for us, and didn't update the tests, so let's update the tests so every test will pass. In the first run of Karma we see that `should render title` test in `AppComponent` is failing.

![Run Karma Tests](/posts/2020/chapter-3-simple-twitter/run-karma-tests.webp "Run Karma Tests")

And it's obvious why it's failing, because it check if there is a `span` element in `AppComponent` with the class `.content` that his text is `simple-twitter-client app is running!`. And there isn't, because we delete the HTML of the `AppComponent` and replace it with a button. For now, we don't have anything to test, our `AppComponent` is pretty much empty, so let's just delete this test.

Next let's check if the linter is pass. We can do it by running `npm run lint`. If everything is good we should see on the terminal the line: `All files pass linting.`.

So we're ready to create a GitHub action workflow that runs the lint and tests, great! If you don't know what GitHub actions is, go to there [documentation page](https://github.com/features/actions) and read about it a little (it's basically a way to get a new and clean VM every commit and run a commands). We'll take the template of a basic Node.js action and start from there.

```yaml
name: Continuous Integration

on: [push]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    strategy:
      matrix:
        node-version: [12.x]

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v1
      - name: Use Node.js ${{ matrix.node-version }}
        uses: actions/setup-node@v1
        with:
          node-version: ${{ matrix.node-version }}
```

From here, we'll add a command to install all the project dependencies, then run the lint, and then the tests, just like we run them on our local machine. So our final file should look like the one below.

```yaml
name: Continuous Integration

on: [push]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    strategy:
      matrix:
        node-version: [12.x]

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v1
      - name: Use Node.js ${{ matrix.node-version }}
        uses: actions/setup-node@v1
        with:
          node-version: ${{ matrix.node-version }}

      - name: install dependencies
        run: npm install

      - name: check lint errors
        run: npm run lint

      - name: run tests
        run: npm run test
```

Now we can commit the changes and push the new branch. After that, we'll create a new PR for this new branch and we can notice that our GitHub action is start right away, with us doing anything. If you'll wait a little bit and let the workflow run, you'll see that it will fail, specifically the the `run tests` step, because it'll fail to start chrome to run the tests.

That's because we can run chrome in a headless VM (a VM without a screen), so we'll create a new npm script to run the Karma tests with a custom browser, the headless version of chrome. We'll call the script `ci-test` and the command will be `ng test --watch=false --browsers=HeadlessChrome`. Now we need to tell Karma what is this _"HeadlessChrome"_ so we'll go to the `karma.conf.js` file and will add a `customLaunchers` right after `restartOnFileChange`. The `customLaunchers` will look like this:

```js
customLaunchers: {
  HeadlessChrome: {
    base: 'ChromeHeadless',
    flags: ['--no-sandbox']
  },
},
```

Now when we run `npm run ci-test` the chrome runs in the background (without opening up), and we see the output of the tests in the terminal, so change our workflow step to run this command instead of `npm run test` and commit the changes and see if it works.

The next task is to add [codecov](https://codecov.io), Codecov is a reporting tool that can process any coverage report format, it'll give us a clearer picture on how we're doing with our tests (what we already cover, and what's left out), so we can improve. The step is to get a token, so we can push our coverage to the platform, so let's log in to Codecov via GitHub login, then to add our repository and we'll get a token key.

![Codecov Token](/posts/2020/chapter-3-simple-twitter/codecov-token.webp "Codecov Token")

Let's copy it and head over to our GitHub repo -> settings -> secrets, and let's create a new `secret`. The name of our `secret` will be `CODECOV_TOKEN` and the value will be the token we copied from Codecov. We do this because our repo is public, and we don't want anyone to see our token (because we want to be the only ones that can push new coverage report to our repository report on Codecov).

Now let's use it in the GitHub action workflow. Angular already have all it takes to generate automatic coverage report from our tests, we just need to add the flag to the npm script command to do that. A simple google search tell us it's `--code-coverage`, so now our `ci-test` script will look like `ng test --watch=false --browsers=HeadlessChrome --code-coverage`.

And to push the coverage report that automatically generated by Angular we'll use the [Codecov GitHub action](https://github.com/codecov/codecov-action) Codecov already built. So let's add that step to our CI workflow, and tell it from where to get the token, and also to fail the CI if this step is failing.

```yaml
- uses: codecov/codecov-action@v1
  with:
    token: ${{ secrets.CODECOV_TOKEN }}
    fail_ci_if_error: true
```

Because we didn't push the coverage to the `master` branch, we didn't see anything happen on our Codecov main page, because it can have a diff between the coverage from our `master` branch to our current branch (`4`) and tell us if we have higher or lower the coverage percentage, but that ok, it'll sort it self out once we'll merge to `master`. In the meantime we can check the [branches Codecov page](https://codecov.io/gh/nirgn975/simple-twitter-client/branches) and see our branch (`4`) there, with the coverage report.

The third and last task in the issue is to add Codecov badge to the `README.md` file. We can get the badge code from the _"Settings"_ page in our repository page at Codecov, and go to the _"Badge"_ tab and just copy the markdown code to the top of our `README.md` file (just under the title of our repo).

Now we can check the last task in our current issue and we're ready to _"Squash and merge"_ this PR to `master`.

## 3. Scaffolding Basic Server

I think we're ready to take a little break from the `client` side of the project and scaffolding the backend. Our backend side will be written with [typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org) which is a superset open-source programming language of [javascript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript) that developed and maintained by Microsoft.

Our backend code will be run on [Node.js](https://nodejs.org), and we'll use the [express](http://expressjs.com) framework. The last tool we need is [nodemon](https://nodemon.io) which is a utility tool that monitor for any changes in our source code and automatically restart the server.

Node.js and Express.js don't have any official cli tool to scaffold a basic project in a bit, like we had with Angular. But there are a lot of GitHub repositories with a basic project template, and all we need to do is to `clone` it and that's it. But I don't really like all that I found, so I made one myself, and we'll use it in this project. But we'll not just `clone` it and call it a day, we're going to built it from scratch, so we'll know how to do it in the future, and in the same time, get to know all the files and how everything is connected and working together.

&nbsp;

### 3.1. Installation & GitHub Preparation

The first thing we need to do is to install couple of tools in our local machine. We already installed Node.js in the [first chapter](/2020/05/chapter-1-simple-twitter/#31-nodejs), so we have that, and `npm`. The next thing is to install typescript, and nodemon in a global mode.

```bash
$ npm install -g typescript
$ npm install -g nodemon
```

Let's head over to GitHub and create a new repo named `simple-twitter-server`, the repo should be empty, and public like we did with the client. Now let's `clone` it to our machine, and get inside it in the terminal.

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:nirgn975/simple-twitter-server.git
$ cd simple-twitter-server
```

Now we just need to create a new npm project with `npm init` command, and we have answer the questions that npm asks as. The _"package name"_ will be `simple-twitter-server`, and for everything else we can just press enter and accept the default value, we'll change it in a bit. The next thing we need to do is to start installing some packages.

```bash
$ npm install --save express
$ npm install --save-dev @types/express @types/node concurrently ts-node tslint typescript
```

The last thing we need to do is to add some scripts to start and build the project.

```json
"scripts": {
  "start": "npm run build && npm run watch",
  "build": "tsc && npm run tslint",
  "serve": "nodemon dist/server.js",
  "watch": "concurrently -k -p \"[{name}]\" -n \"TypeScript,Node\" -c \"yellow.bold,cyan.bold\" \"tsc -w\" \"npm run serve\"",
  "tslint": "tslint -c tslint.json -p tsconfig.json"
},
```

Don't try to run them yet, because it's not going to succeed, we need to add some typescript configuration for it to work. But before we do that, let's just go over the scripts and understand them.

- The first one, `start`, will be the script we'll use the most, it'll run the npm `build` script and the npm `watch` script.
- The next one is the `build` which is compile the typescript code with `tsc` (which is the default compiler of typescript and you have it because we installed the `typescript` package), and it runs another npm script named `tslint`.
- The `serve` script run the compiled entry point file with nodemon (to watch for changes in the file).
- The `watch` script run couple of commands in concurrently, with the [concurrently package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/concurrently). It runs the `tsc` compiler and the npm `serve` script from above. The smart thing it's doing is to add the `[TypeScript]` or `[Node]` keywords to the beginning of the command and color code them with yellow if it's `[TypeScript]` or in cyan if it's `[Node]`.
- The last script, `tslint` is running the typescript linter to check for errors, and we give it some rules and configuration files.

Now that we know what every script do, we understand that we just need to create 2 files for the scripts to work, the rules (`tslint.json`) file and the configuration (`tsconfig.json`) file. So let's create them next to the `package.json` file, and we'll add some basic rules to `tslint.json` file:

```json
{
  "rules": {
    "class-name": true,
    "comment-format": [true, "check-space"],
    "indent": [true, "spaces"],
    "one-line": [true, "check-open-brace", "check-whitespace"],
    "no-var-keyword": true,
    "quotemark": [true, "double", "avoid-escape"],
    "semicolon": [true, "always", "ignore-bound-class-methods"],
    "whitespace": [true, "check-branch", "check-decl", "check-operator", "check-module", "check-separator", "check-type"],
    "typedef-whitespace": [
      true,
      {
        "call-signature": "nospace",
        "index-signature": "nospace",
        "parameter": "nospace",
        "property-declaration": "nospace",
        "variable-declaration": "nospace"
      },
      {
        "call-signature": "onespace",
        "index-signature": "onespace",
        "parameter": "onespace",
        "property-declaration": "onespace",
        "variable-declaration": "onespace"
      }
    ],
    "no-internal-module": true,
    "no-trailing-whitespace": true,
    "no-null-keyword": true,
    "prefer-const": true,
    "jsdoc-format": true
  }
}
```

And then write the basic configuration for `tsconfig.json` file:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "module": "commonjs",
    "target": "es6",
    "noImplicitAny": false,
    "moduleResolution": "node",
    "skipLibCheck": true,
    "sourceMap": true,
    "outDir": "dist",
    "baseUrl": ".",
    "paths": {
      "*": ["node_modules/*", "src/types/*"]
    }
  },
  "include": ["src/**/*"]
}
```

Those configuration and rules are basic templates you can find on the documentation sites of typescript and tslint packages, so we'll not go over them. Now, we just need the `server.ts` file, so the `tsc` will compile it to `server.js` and and npm `serve` script will have something to run. The default path the compiler looks for this file is under a directory named `src`, so we'll create it there.

```bash
$ touch src/server.ts
```

Now, just to see some output on the screen and be sure everything is compiled and running we'll write `console.log("hello world!")` in the `server.ts` file. And when we run the project (with `npm start` in the terminal) we'll see _"hello world!"_ in the terminal output.

![First Run Terminal Output](/posts/2020/chapter-3-simple-twitter/first-run-terminal-output.webp "First Run Terminal Output")

Before we commit everything, we want to add a `.gitignore` file, so we actually don't commit everything, because we don't need everything. What we don't need? the `dist` directory for example, it's a directory with files that are automatically generated from our source code, we don't need them, we just need our source code. And we don't need the `node_modules` directory, because it's a directory with all the packages that we installed and the rules to installed them are saved in the `package.json` file, so we just need to save that file.

We have a free website that can help us create this `.gitignore` file. [gitignore.io](https://www.toptal.com/developers/gitignore), we'll add there some keywords like `macOS`, `Node`, `linux`, `dotenv`, and we'll create a file named `.gitignore` next to the `package.json` file and paste to it the output that the website will show us.

```bash
$ touch .gitignore
```

Before we commit we'll create a `README.md` file (`$ touch README.md`) with some instructions.

````markdown
# Simple Twitter Server

This is the backend of Simple Twitter project. This project is for educational purpose only.

## Our Stack

- [Express](http://expressjs.com)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com)

## Pre Requirements

1. [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org).
2. [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org).
3. [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com).

## Installation

1. Install nodemon globally `npm i -g nodemon`.
1. Install requirements with `npm install`.
1. Run the server with `npm start`.
1. Open your http client at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).

**Configurations**

Create a `.env` file at the root directory (this file should not be commit).

Here is an example of the `.env` file:

```
DATABASE_URI=mongodb://localhost/simpletwitter
JWT=SIMTWITT
REFRESHJWT=RESIMTWITT
PORT=8080
LOG_LEVEL=info
NODE_ENV=dev
```

## Tests

- Run `npm run tslint` to check for ESLint mistakes.
- Run `npm test` to run the integration tests.
````

And now we have a basic npm project and we're ready to commit everything on `master` branch (because it's our first commit, we cannot open a PR because we don't have a default branch to compare it to it, yet), and push it to GitHub.

```bash
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "Init"
$ git push origin master
```

&nbsp;

### 3.2. Basic Express Server with MongoDB

The next thing we're going to do is to create an issue. Because we have some code in `master` branch, we can now open an PR and compare it to `master`, so'll create an issue first and write there all of the tasks we plan to do in this PR.

```markdown
- [ ] Basic express server.
- [ ] Load env files.
- [ ] Create a config instance.
- [ ] Connect to MongoDB.
```

Let's start with the first task, to create a basic `express` server. We'll do it in a separate file (we'll call it `app`) and then we'll import that `exprerss` instance in the `server` file.

But let's not forget that we first need to move to a new branch, and as usual we'll call that branch name like the issue number we just opend.

```bash
$ git checkout -b 2
$ touch src/app.ts
```

The first thing we want to do is to `import` the `express` package. Then we'll create a `class` named `App` and create there a local variable named `app`, it'll be from `express.Application` type. For this `class` we'll create a `constructor` and there we'll create an `express` application and save it in our `app` variable.

```typescript
import * as express from "express";

export class App {
  public app: express.Application;

  /**
   * @class App
   * @constructor
   */
  constructor() {
    this.app = express();
  }
}
```

Next we want to create two private methods for that `class`, the first one will register some [Middlewares](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middleware), and the second one will register our future routes. Let's start with the first one, for all of the middlewares we'll use. But first what is a middleware?

> Express middleware are functions that execute during the lifecycle of a request to the Express server. Each middleware has access to the HTTP request and response for each route (or path) it's attached to. In fact, Express itself is compromised wholly of middleware functions.

So let's install some packages that are middlewares. The [cors](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cors) package will help us to enable [CORS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing). The [morgan](https://www.npmjs.com/package/morgan) package will help us log all of the requests so we can keep track on what's happening with our server. The [body-parser](https://www.npmjs.com/package/body-parser) will help us parse the `body` of an incoming request.

```bash
$ npm install --save cors morgan body-parser
```

And then we can import them at the top of the file

```typescript
import * as cors from "cors";
import * as morgan from "morgan";
import * as express from "express";
import * as bodyParser from "body-parser";
```

And create a method with the name `configMiddleware` in the `App` class, and `use` them with our express app.

```typescript
/**
 * Registr middlewares.
 *
 * @class App
 * @method configMiddleware
 * @return void
 */
private configMiddleware() {
  this.app.use(cors());
  this.app.use(morgan("[:date[clf]] - :method :url :status :res[content-length] - :response-time ms ':user-agent'"));
  this.app.use(bodyParser.json());
  this.app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({ extended: true }));
}
```

The final step is to create a `router` variable right after all the `import` statements.

```typescript
const router: express.Router = express.Router();
```

We'll not use it yet, but we want to create it now because we know we're going to need it in the future. For now let's create a new method with the name `configureRoutes` and there we'll create a new endpoint in the root (`/`) path that we'll return us a simple text that our express app is working.

```typescript
/**
 * Registr routes.
 *
 * @class App
 * @method configureRoutes
 * @return void
 */
private configureRoutes() {
  this.app.use("/", (_, res) => res.send("app is working!!!"));
}
```

And let's not forget that we need to call those methods from the `constructor`, so we'll add those lines right after our `express` app creation.

```typescript
this.configMiddleware();
this.configureRoutes();
```

That's it, we have a basic express app. Let's head over to the `server.ts` file and use this app, so we can check that everyhing is working. In the `server.ts` file we'll import `express` and `chalk`. [chalk](https://www.npmjs.com/package/chalk) is a package to help us styling our text in the terminal (we'll use it to add colors to our logs). The third `import` will be our app class we created earlier.

```typescript
import * as express from "express";
import * as chalk from "chalk";

import { App } from "./app";
```

Now we'll create a `server` class and in the `constructor` we'll handle some Node.js errors and create an instance of that `App`.

```typescript
/**
 * @class Server
 */
export class Server {
  public app: express.Application;

  /**
   * @class Api
   * @constructor
   */
  constructor() {
    // Set handler for all unhandled exceptions.
    process.on("uncaughtException", (err) => {
      console.log("Unhandled exception: \n\t", err);
    });

    // Set handler for all unhandled promise rejections.
    process.on("unhandledRejection", (err) => {
      console.error("unhandled rejection: \n\t", err);
    });

    this.app = new App().app;
  }
}
```

And at the end of the file we'll export an instance of the `Server` for testing (we'll use it in the future when we'll write out unit tests).

```typescript
// Export for testing
export default new Server();
```

So everything is good, we create our `App` instance, but we need to `listen` to some port with this API. So let's add a new method with the name `configurExpress` in the `Server` class and set the express port and start listen on that port.

```typescript
/**
 * Express configuration.
 *
 * @class Server
 * @method configurExpress
 * @return void
 */
private configurExpress() {
  this.app.set("port", "8080");

  if (!module.parent) {
    this.app.listen(this.app.get("port"), () => {
      console.log(chalk.cyan(`✨ App is running at http://localhost:${this.app.get("port")} in ${this.app.get("env")} mode ✨`));
      console.log(chalk.red(`✨ Press CTRL-C to stop✨ \n`));
    });
  }
}
```

And don't forget to call this method in the last line of the `constructor`.

```typescript
this.configurExpress();
```

Now if we head back to the terminal and run the start command we can see our Express app is created and is listening on port `8080`.

```bash
$ npm start
```

![Our Express App is a live!](/posts/2020/chapter-3-simple-twitter/express-app-live.webp "Our Express App is a live!")

If we'll [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest) to make a request to the root path on our `localhost:8080` we'll get the `app is working!!!` text in return.

![Insomnia Root Request](/posts/2020/chapter-3-simple-twitter/insomnia-root_request.webp "Insomnia Root Request")

And now it's a really good time to commit.

```bash
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "Create a basic express app"
$ git push origin 2
```

### 3.3. Configuration & Environment Variables

In this section we'll create a configuration file, this file will "read" the environment variables based on the environment we're currently in (prod / dev / test) and load the right configurations.

So, let's create a file called `config.ts` in a `util` directory, inside the `src` directory. In this file we'll use the [dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv) and [lodash](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lodash) packages, so let's install them.

```bash
$ npm install --save dotenv lodash
```

Now we need to create a class named `Config` in the new `config.ts` file we created. In this file we'll create a `config` object (variable) that will hold all of our configurations that we'll use later. and in the `constructor` of the class we'll use the `dotent` package to import the `.env` file.

```typescript
import * as dotenv from "dotenv";
import * as _ from "lodash";

/**
 * @class Config
 */
export default class Config {
  public config = {
    logging: false,
    seed: false,
    db: "",
    environment: "",
    port: process.env.PORT || 4000,
    tokenExpireTime: 60 * 60, // 1 hours (in seconds).
    refreshTokenLife: 60 * 60 * 24, // 24 hours (in seconds).
    secrets: {
      jwt: process.env.JWT || "SIMTWITT",
      refreshTokenSecret: process.env.REFRESHJWT || "RESIMTWITT",
    },
  };

  /**
   * @class Config
   * @constructor
   */
  constructor() {
    dotenv.config({ path: ".env" });
  }
}
```

Now we'll create a `.env` file in the root path of the project, and just like we written earlier in the `README.md` file we'll add all the environment variables we need for the project. We already have an example for the `.env` file but I'll write it here again.

```
DATABASE_URI=mongodb://localhost/simpletwitter
JWT=SIMTWITT
REFRESHJWT=RESIMTWITT
PORT=8080
LOG_LEVEL=info
NODE_ENV=dev
```

Here is a short description that explaining what `dotenv` is doing.

> Dotenv is a module that loads environment variables from a .env file into process.env. Storing configuration in the environment separate from code is based on [The Twelve-Factor App methodology](https://12factor.net/config).

The last thing we need to do in the configuration file is to load the right environment file and merge it's content with the `config` variable. To do that let's create a new method in `config.ts` file and call it `configDB`. In this function we'll load the right file based on the `NODE_ENV` environment variable.

```typescript
/**
 * Load testing or production environment variables.
 *
 * @class Config
 * @method configDB
 * @return config object
 */
private configDB() {
  process.env.NODE_ENV = process.env.NODE_ENV || "dev";
  this.config.environment = process.env.NODE_ENV;
  return require(`./envs/${process.env.NODE_ENV}`);
}
```

Now, we need to call this method inside the `constructor` and merge it's content with the `config` variable. To do this we'll use the `lodash` function called [merge](https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.15#merge).

```typescript
const envConfig = this.configDB();
this.config = _.merge(this.config, envConfig);
```

Our `NODE_ENV` environment variable is `dev` (because that's what we wrote in the `.env` file), so in the `configDB` we're trying to load (`require`) a file called `dev` inside a `envs` directory, but we don't have it yet, so let's create it. And a long side with it, let's create a `test` and `prod` files, so we'll have different configurations for each of the environments.

```bash
$ touch src/util/envs/test.ts
$ touch src/util/envs/dev.ts
$ touch src/util/envs/prod.ts
```

The `test.ts` file will have

```typescript
module.exports = {
  logging: false, // disbable logging for testing.
  seed: true,
  db: process.env.DATABASE_URI,
  port: process.env.PORT,
};
```

The `dev.ts` file will have

```typescript
module.exports = {
  logging: true, // enabled logging for development.
  seed: true,
  db: process.env.DATABASE_URI,
  port: process.env.PORT,
};
```

The `prod.ts` file will have

```typescript
module.exports = {
  logging: true, // enabled logging for production.
  seed: false,
  db: process.env.DATABASE_URI,
  port: process.env.PORT,
};
```

The last thing we need to do is to `import` the `config` file in `server.ts` file.

```typescript
import Config from "./util/config";
```

And then create an instance of the `config` class. We'll do it inside the `constructor` right after the line we create our `express` app.

```typescript
this.config = new Config();
```

Now, if we'll run the project (`npm start`) the `config` class should be created and load our environment variables (we can check that out with a simple `console.log` command, but I'll leave you that job). If you want to take a look at the final code for this section, as always, you can head over to the Pull Request and look at the [commit hash](https://github.com/nirgn975/simple-twitter-server/pull/3/commits/55f4968a6263d859bb7f5625434326549f36fc10) for this section.

### 3.4. MongoDB & Dummy Data

In this section we'll connect to the MongoDB database (we installed it already on our local machine in the [first chapter](/2020/05/chapter-1-simple-twitter/#21-mongodb)) and we'll create a `Seed` file to load some dummy data to our database (we'll not load it yet, just create the file).

So, first let's connect to our Database. To do this let's install [mongoose](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mongoose). Mongoose is an ODM (much like [ORM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-relational_mapping) just for NoSQL documents databases) and it helps us doing validation, casting and business logic. With mongoose we don't need to deal with the MongoDB client.

```bash
npm install --save mongoose
```

Now, let's import it at the top of the `server.ts` file

```typescript
import * as mongoose from "mongoose";
```

The next step is to create a new function in `server.ts` file and call it `connectMongoDB`. This function will use `mongoose` to `connect` to the MongoDB database and log an error if something went wrong.

```typescript
/**
 * Connect to MongoDB.
 *
 * @class Server
 * @method connectMongoDB
 * @return void
 */
private async connectMongoDB() {
  await mongoose.connect(this.config.config.db, {
    useCreateIndex: true,
    useNewUrlParser: true,
    useUnifiedTopology: true,
    promiseLibrary: global.Promise,
  } as mongoose.ConnectionOptions);

  await mongoose.connection.on("error", (error: any) => {
    console.error(`MongoDB connection error. Please make sure MongoDB is running. ${error}`);
    process.exit(1);
  });
}
```

And let's not forget to call it inside the `constructor` (right before we call our `configurExpress` method).

```typescript
this.connectMongoDB();
```

While we're in the `server.ts` file, let's change the port we run our express app and take it from the `config` instead of hard coded it.

```typescript
this.app.set("port", this.config.config.port);
```

Now, the last thing we need to do is to create our seed script, so we can load, in the future, some dummy data to our database, so it'll be easier to "play" with our endpoints and to write tests. So, let's create a `seed.ts` file.

```bash
$ touch src/util/seed.ts
```

We need to do some imports there and create a `Seed` class.

```typescript
import * as _ from "lodash";
import * as chalk from "chalk";
import * as mongoose from "mongoose";

/**
 * @class Seed
 */
export default class Seed {
  /**
   * @class Seed
   * @constructor
   */
  constructor() {}
}
```

We'll create a new `public` method named `seeding` so we can call it from outside the class. This method will log some text so we can see what is going on, and then call a private method to clean the database (empty it from previous data) and we get a promise in return, when we'll get it we'll cal a new method (`private` one so we can only call it within the class) to create a new dummy data users.

```typescript
/**
 * Seed the Database.
 *
 * @class Seed
 * @method seeding
 * @return void
 */
public seeding() {
  console.log(chalk.yellow("💦 Cleaning the DB 💦"));
  this.cleanDB()
    .then(this.createUsers);

  console.log(chalk.yellow(`Seeded DB with`));
  console.log(chalk.yellow("🎉 Finish seeding the DB 🎉"));
}
```

Now it's time to create the `cleanDB` method. It'll connect to the database using `mongoose` and will drop all the collection in it. After we'll drop it, we'll log that we start seeding the database (And let's add some emojis for fun).

```typescript
/**
 * Clean all the database documents.
 *
 * @class Seed
 * @method cleanDB
 * @return promise
 */
private cleanDB() {
  mongoose.connection.dropDatabase().catch((error: any) => {
    console.error("error dropping collections", error);
  });
  console.log(chalk.yellow("💪 Start seeding the DB 💪"));
  return new Promise((resolve) => { resolve(""); });
}
```

Now, we don't have a `user` model or dummy data yet, so for the `createUsers` method, we'll just create it for now and leave it empty.

```typescript
/**
 * Create fixtures for users.
 *
 * @class Seed
 * @method createUsers
 * @return promise
 */
private createUsers(data) {
}
```

The last thing is left to do is just run the `seeding` method when we need to seed the database. So let's head back to the `server.ts` file and import the `Seed` class.

```typescript
import Seed from "./util/seed";
```

And inside the `connectMongoDB` method, right at the end of the method, after we already connected to the database let's call the method.

```typescript
if (this.config.config.seed) {
  const seed = new Seed();
  seed.seeding();
}
```

That's it, we did it! Last not forget to add everything to the git staging area, commit, and push it. After that we can _"Squash and merge"_ this Pull request.

## 4. Summary

This was a long post! I didn't plan for it to be that long. In the future they will be shorter. But we did a lot! we bootstrap our client and server applications. We're ready to write the first "custom" code for our Simple Twitter website in the next chapter. This is awesome!

In the next chapter we'll keep our focus on the server, we'll create the user model, some routes and endpoints, we'll add some auth endpoints and logic so we'll have everything ready to do the sign up and login processes, and of course write some tests because we have to tests our code to make sure everything is working correctly.
