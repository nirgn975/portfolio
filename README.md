> This is my private website, which contains the fifth iteration of my blog ("Stories of a Lifelong Student"). I always wanted to open source as much as I can in my blog, and when I decided to rebuilt and redesign it, it was the perfect chance to move to GitHub and open source the code, the images, the posts themselves, and especially my process.
>
> All of the posts are written by me, but I'm more then happy to receive some PRs to correct my grammar, a misleading information, an update to something, or basically everything!
>
> All the things I write in this blog are my own thoughts and personal experiments. I'm not responsible for anything you might try to do, and not encourages anything that is not within the law. All the info in the posts are for learning and expanding horizons only!
>
> The posts are usually about computer science (data structures, algorithms, computer networks, operating system, and machine learning), open source (linux, git, code contribution), software development (programming, programming languages, frameworks, design patterns, and architecture), security information (pen testing and whitehat hacking), android and reverse engineering.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. [Nodejs & npm](https://nodejs.org)
2. [Astro](https://astro.build)

## 🏗️ Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```
/
├── public/
│   └── favicon.svg
├── src/
│   ├── components/
│   │   └── Card.astro
│   ├── layouts/
│   │   └── Layout.astro
│   └── pages/
│       └── index.astro
└── package.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## 🧞 Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                | Action                                             |
| :--------------------- | :------------------------------------------------- |
| `npm install`          | Installs dependencies                              |
| `npm run dev`          | Starts local dev server at `localhost:3000`        |
| `npm run build`        | Build your production site to `./dist/`            |
| `npm run preview`      | Preview your build locally, before deploying       |
| `npm run astro ...`    | Run CLI commands like `astro add`, `astro preview` |
