I saw it happens in Twitter, where people, at the end of the year, recommend the books they read. So I thought I'll do something similar by writing a little bit about the book I read the past year but also adding some more like Podcasts and YouTube channels. I'll keep it close to the blog main areas and relevant to the international audience.

&nbsp;

## 1. Books

Let's start with the basics, books. My main objective is to read 3 to 5 books a year, it changes because every book length is different at sometimes it can really affect the time it takes me to finish it. I really love to read books, I consider it one of the most affective ways to learn something (for me).

### 1.1. Countdown to Zero Day

**Full name**: Countdown to Zero Day: Stuxnet and the Launch of the World's First Digital Weapon

**Author**: Kim Zetter

**Amazon**: [link](https://www.amazon.com/Countdown-Zero-Day-Stuxnet-Digital/dp/0770436196)

*I really recommend this book!* Kim Zetter knows how to do investigative journalism and just tell a good story. She tells the story behind the virus, now known as Stuxnet, that sabotaged Iran’s nuclear efforts and shows how its existence has changed the future of cyberwarfare.

### 1.2. Mindf*ck

**Full name**: Mindf*ck: Cambridge Analytica and the Plot to Break America

**Author**: Christopher Wylie

**Amazon**: [link](https://www.amazon.com/Mindf-Cambridge-Analytica-Break-America/dp/0593229142)

*I would not recommend this book*. Christopher Wylie give himself a more important role than he really had in the story (for my opinion). The book doesn't add much more about the story of Cambridge Analytica then the Netflix movie [The Great Hack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great_Hack). Where it really shine is on Christopher Wylie own bio and the early days of Cambridge Analytica (how it was created). He leaved Cambridge Analytica before they took the Trump and Brexit campaigns.

### 1.3. The Code Book

**Full name**: The Code Book: The Science of Secrecy from Ancient Egypt to Quantum Cryptography

**Author**: Simon Singh

**Amazon**: [link](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004IK8PLE/ref=dbs_a_def_rwt_hsch_vapi_tkin_p1_i0)

*I highly recommend this book!* An old book (from 2011) but none the less still relevant. Simon Singh knows how to convey technical and mathematical explanations, and he took you on a journey of the history of encryption and portraits of the remarkable personalities who wrote and broke the world's most difficult codes.

The book is accessible, compelling, and remarkably far-reaching for everyone (if you're not so interested in cryptography).

### 1.4. Permanent Record

**Full name**: Permanent Record

**Author**: Edward Snowden

**Amazon**: [link](https://www.amazon.com/Permanent-Record-Edward-Snowden/dp/1250237238)

reading..

### 1.5. Kubernetes Up & Running (second edition)

**Full name**: Kubernetes: Up and Running: Dive into the Future of Infrastructure

**Author**: Brendan Burns, Joe Beda, & Kelsey Hightower

**Amazon**: [link](https://www.amazon.com/Kubernetes-Running-Dive-Future-Infrastructure/dp/1492046531)

*I highly recommend this book for anyone who want to learn about Kubernetes!* I'm no DevOps, but we use Kubernetes in my team at work and I didn't know nothing about (other then what it use to). I already knew Docker and wished to learn more about Kubernetes so I picked this book and it did not disappoint.

They explain how Kubernetes fits into the lifecycle of a distributed application. You’ll learn how to use tools and APIs to automate scalable distributed systems, whether it’s for online services, machine learning applications, or a cluster of Raspberry Pi computers.

&nbsp;

## 2. Podcasts

The second method I use to learn and keep myself updated in this area is podcasts. I can listening to one will driving, work, etc. There are so many podcasts in this genre, here are the good ones.

### 2.1. Malicious Life

**Host**: Ran Levi

**Website**: [link](https://malicious.life)

**Twitter**: [link](https://twitter.com/MaliciousLife)

> Malicious Life by Cybereason tells the unknown stories of the history of cybersecurity, with comments and reflections by real hackers, security experts, journalists, and politicians.

*Highly recommend!* Ran knows how to tell a story, and can make every "ok" story to a brilliant and captive one. Malicious Life is a podcast about the cybersecurity world, you'll hear about historical events with interviews from the people who were there.

### 2.2. Darknet Diaries

**Host**: Jack Rhysider

**Website**: [link](https://darknetdiaries.com)

**Twitter**: [link](https://twitter.com/darknetdiaries)

> True stories from the dark side of the Internet.

*Highly recommend!* Jack Rhysider is a great host and knows how to tell a story. Once you start listening to an episode Jack will keep you on the edge of your seat and you'll not stop until you finished it, and then you'll play the next one right after it.

### 2.3. Cyber by Motherboard

**Host**: Ben Makuch, Lorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai, & Jseph Cox

**Website**: [link](https://www.vice.com/en_us/section/tech)

**Twitter**: [link](https://twitter.com/Motherboard)

*Recommend*. This is like a news podcast but focused just on infosec. Each week there is a new episode, where they will break down some of the biggest topics in the cybersecurity world.

### 2.4. Go Time - by The Changelog

If you're into Python, you'll love listening to this podcast. From talks about popular packages to interviews with popular software developers, data scientists and just incredible hobbyists doing amazing things in Python - you'll hear it all.

&nbsp;

## 3. YouTube

YouTube, in my book, is the most important platform to learn something new. But you need to search for it. Unlink a book and / or a podcast where you can read or listen for casual stuff, when you watch a YouTube video you probably wanted to learn something new and specifically search for videos about that topic. So here are the channel I follow to learn things in infoSec.

## 5. Summary

Those are the main tools I use to learn more and expend my knowledge in software development and cybersecurity. Each platform has it's advantages and disadvantages so I use them all, each for different purpose. YouTube is the main source for cyber related things, while books are for knowledge expending and software development learning. Podcasts are just general tool to hear about know stuff, learn about new tools, and expend my overall general knowledge.
