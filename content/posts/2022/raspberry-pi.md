raspberry pi

## 1. Hugo Theme

raspberry pi

&nbsp;

## 3. Summary

The project will get into the showcase at Hugo - an issue has been opened and all the checks are green.

I really hope you find it useful and if you ever use it or just play with the theme, Iâ€™ll be thrilled to get a link or just hear from you. If you have any issues or any questions feel free to open a [new discussion at GitHub](https://github.com/nirgn975/devRes/discussions).
