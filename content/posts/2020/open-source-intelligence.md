Every operation need good intel, and good intel is hard to find. Or is it?

[OSINT (or Open Source Intelligence)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_intelligence) is the operation of collecting and analyzing information about a target from various sources. A lot of times you'll see the terms "public" or "open" sources but let's be honest here, this is false and that's why I wrote *various sources*.

This is not to say that hacking to someone and steal his data is OSINT, because it's not. But not all the sources we'll use are public and open to everyone, and their data isn't collected by those services in an open way (innocently and / or with user consent).

When talking about reconnaissance, the first step of red teams in an engagement (or 5 phases of [ethical] hacking), people means passive reconnaissance. It's the attempt to gain information about a target (a human, a computer and / or a network) without actively engaging with it.

In this post I want you to tag a long with me when I'm doing two reconnaissances. One on a real human target, and the second on a compony. They gave me their permission to do it of course. I will censor certain personal details but I'll talk about it all. There are a lot of tools to help us do it, and we'll use them, but none the less there is a lot of manual hard work (and drop of art) to be done.
