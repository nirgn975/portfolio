In the (great) show [Mr Robot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr._Robot) Elliot hacked his therapist's boyfriend's email account by calling him and pretend to be someone from his bank and asked him for some general info. And maybe you'll say it's not "real", but most breaches we hear about start with OSINT, Phishing, and/or social engineering (e.g. gathering information, and trick or outsmart the target).

So I thought to myself it'll be a great training to try and mimk this attack, and also great opportunity to dive deeper and learn one of the most famous tools out there in the pentest community: [Metasploit](https://www.metasploit.com).
