I was minding my own business and scrolling X (formally Twitter) when I encountered a post from a designer that put subscriptions logos on top of a calendar month. The UI/UX was stunning! People were loving it and the post got a lot of likes, replies and basically a lot of engagement.

Right then and there I decided to do a thing - build it. I limit myself to 1 month to release an MVP and see if people are liking it and decided that the pricing model should be a ‚Äúpay once own it for life‚Äù, because it‚Äôs kinda funny to pay subscription to monitor other subscriptions.

The technology I chose to do it is a Chrome Extension, because I can store your data locally and don‚Äôt need a server (help me with the pricing model of paying once) and I can inject a button to your Gmail and get the subscriptions data from the receipt email (it also good timing).

I was off to the races, and it‚Äôll not be an understatement to say that I underestimated the amount of work I thought would be required. Nonetheless I finished the Extension and the website a few days before my deadline and I was thrilled!

This is my first product that I‚Äôm launching, charging for it, and actively searching for customers. I was a true indie hacker / solopreneur now. But how do I get customers? How do I tell the world about it?

I got back to X and started asking people, joined indie hackers communities, started to follow some solopreneurs and read their posts, and then I realized that distribution is really hard, maybe even harder than building the product.

I started writing replies to posts about related topics and insert my extension if it‚Äôs appropriate. I listed my extension on [product hunt](https://www.producthunt.com/products/subwatch-3), [betalist](https://betalist.com/startups/subwatch), [chromehunt](https://www.chromehunt.app/extensions/subwatch), and microlaunch. And I got a few sales ü•≥

The sales were the fuel to keep me going. Every email notification about a new sale was a celebration. I can‚Äôt describe the feeling of someone paying for my product. But there was one thing that bugged me: I was out of ideas about features and updates. Sure, I caught a few bugs and fixed them, but what‚Äôs next?

And then the ideas start to come to me, from paying users, in the form of feature requests. I was so happy I got to work immediately and hammered most of them in a week! Even updated the website to reflect some of the new features.

Where am I going from here?

- Keep finding free directories and launch my extension in them.
- Working on the website SEO.
- Find Subreddit and Facebook groups to post in (I‚Äôm mainly focused on X in my personal life so most of the traffic comes from there at the moment).
- Will add a 7 days trial.
- And I have one other big idea for the product that I‚Äôm considering implementing but not sure yet.
