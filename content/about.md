This blog is in it's fifth iteration. I started back in 2012 on blogger, the blog was in Hebrew and it was the beginning of my journey in tech, I moved on from there, now the blog is in English (sorry if you spot any typos and grammar mistakes, it's obviously not my native language) and it's on a lot more subjects (mainly computers, software development, hacking, and related stuff that are interested me).

I also evolve from the technical side of it, the source code of the blog is on [GitHub](https://github.com/nirgn975/stories-of-a-lifelong-student) (open sourced), I write the posts in [markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown), use [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) to build and generate the website, and host it on [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com).

**The break:** I had a "small" break from writing back in 2017 until now (2020), but I'm back! I love writing, I think it's really important to share and you can learn a lot by doing it. I just needed to find more time, and I'll make more room for it now.

Before I finish I just want to share with you a quote that I take with me for life and especially when writing posts, and you can count on the posts to be in this spirit.
